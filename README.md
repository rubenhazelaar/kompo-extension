# Kompo Extension

This repository contains utility functions which are provided for ease-of-use or syntactic sugar, more or less specific for the Kompo library.

BEWARE: It extends builtin javascript objects, so if you don't like that don't use this repository. [github.com/rubenhazelaar/kompo-util](Take a look at Kompo Util)

## Kompo

Kompo is a react js like library which tries to stay as simple as possible. No virtual DOM or JSX. 
Kompo loves the DOM & makes it possible to build interfaces through components.
